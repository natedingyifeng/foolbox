## Foolbox

Foolbox is a Python toolbox to create adversarial examples that fool neural networks. It requires `Python`, `NumPy` and `SciPy`.

### First

Foolbox is maintained and supported [here](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox)

This is just where I post attacks I need for testing. 


### Installation

Same installation procedure. 
```bash
   pip install foolbox
```
Though it is highly recommended that you install in editable mode  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neale/foolbox.git
cd foolbox
pip install --editable .
```

I'm testing with Python 2.7 here. I don't want to be, but here we are. That said, everything should by Python 3.5 complient. 


### Documentation

The real documentation is available [here](http://foolbox.readthedocs.io/)

I have posted a thorough example with each new attack, as well at the attack itself at the top level directory.
